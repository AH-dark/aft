/**
 * A background completion detaches a waiting command call on a real OpenCode 2
 * host, as a new user message does.
 *
 * The host admits AFT's completion wake through `session.synthetic`, which
 * does not run the session `prompt` hook where a typed message detaches a
 * waiting call, so AFT detaches the session's waits itself once the wake is
 * admitted. Without that, a `wait: true` call started before the background
 * task finished sits out its whole command even though the result the agent is
 * waiting for has arrived.
 *
 * Needs AFT_V2_HOST_BINARY (the load matrix supplies a pinned host), a built
 * `dist/`, and an `aft` binary; see `v2-host.ts`.
