# Fail when Git tracks a file under .cortexkit/ that the ignore rules exclude.
#
# .cortexkit/ holds private CortexKit working files (drafts, reports, scratch,
# agent state). Only the shared parts are meant to be tracked: release-notes/,
# skills/, rules/ and WORKER.md, plus the project files the repository's
# .gitignore re-includes by name. Ignore rules do not stop Git from carrying a
# file it already tracks (one committed before the rule existed, or added with
# `git add -f`), so such a file keeps being pushed. This check lists every
# tracked file that the ignore rules exclude, however it got tracked.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-cortexkit-tracking.sh [repository-dir]
# Exits 0 when nothing is listed, 1 when tracked ignored files exist, and 2
# when Git itself fails.
